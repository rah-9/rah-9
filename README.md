## About Me

I am a Computer Science undergraduate at IIIT Sri City (CGPA: 8.69), working on real-world AI systems that emphasize
**reliability, interpretability, and end-to-end engineering** rather than isolated models.

My work spans Machine Learning, Explainable AI, Multi-Agent Systems, and full-stack AI applications.
